# Bake a Cake and Eat It Too!

## Repository
<Link to your project's public GitHub respository>

## Description
My program will allow the user to design a cake that they can take one bite of before the program forces quits on them. 
It is relevant to media and digital arts because it allows the user to come up their own design for a cake ad will play on the 
occasionally thing in games where it lightly scares the user by taking control of the program when it force quits on its own.

## Features
- Cake making
	- In the terminal it will prompt the user for an input of cerain flavours, icings, and toppings that will 
    determine what the cake looks like before it is printed on screen
- Eating
	- by pressing spacebar the user will place a small black mark on th screen that makes it look like a bite has been taken out of 
  the cake and will print text on the bottom of the cake saying "wait..." and whe pressed again it will print a small bomb in 
  place of the cake and say "the cake was a lie!" at the bottom
- Explosion 
	- There will a counter loop for how many times spacebar is hit so that if it is pressed more than twice it will cause a flashing
  red to appear over the whole screen for a short time which will done in a similar way to the digital rain lab and after it is 
  done flashing it will close out the game

## Challenges
- I might need to research how to get the cake too print in the specific shape I want with user inputs determing the colors and 
  some of the shapes
- will need to learn how to make a couter loop using user inputs and how to put text on the screen usinf draw.text
- I will need to research how to get the flashig to happen for only a certain amount of time

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be that the code flows smoothly together and the cake has no issues appearing on screen and it is a fun 
  shock factor at the end when the cake exploded upon being revealed to be a lie.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- At the very least I want the cake to have one editable feature, there to be a bomb that appears under the cake and for the
  program to forcequit after revealing the bomb.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Implement the base game code of an intialization, game loop, and shut down
  2. Add in code to get user input and get the first pass of the cake class done

- Week 2
  1. Get the code to draw the cake according to user input on screen 
  2. get bomb to be revealed under the cake

- Week N (Final)
  1. Make explosion animation
  2. Get the program to force quit itself
  3. Code cleanup
